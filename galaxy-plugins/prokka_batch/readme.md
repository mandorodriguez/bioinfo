## PROKKA batch

The script allows to annotate multiple genomes at once by taking PROKKA arguments from a table

### Example annotation file  
    strain	 locustag	 centre	 genus	      species	plasmid	kingdom
    strainA	 xxx	     centre	 Escherichia	coli		
    strainB	 yyy	     centre  Escherichia	coli	   p90

The xml file was modified accordingly to take the new input file.
